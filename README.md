# DrugOrchestra
DrugOrchestra is a multi-task learning neural model used for jointly training tasks of drug target prediction, drug response prediction, drug side effect prediction. It is proven to be better compared to single-task learning (training only one task) under the same training conditions. The paper is accepted by **RECOMB2021**. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.385757v1

## How to run the code
Please refer to the https://github.com/jiangdada1221/DrugOrchestra/tree/master/MTL to see examples. <br />

## To make predictions
Run the script in 'Predict' folder by: <br />
<br />
python make_prediction.py --SMILES arg1 --path_to_gnn_model arg2 --path_to_MTL arg3 <br />
<br />
arg1 is the input SMILES string you want to use to make predictions <br />
arg2 is the path to the pretrained GNN model for drug embedding extraction <br />
args is the path to the pretrained MTL model <br /> <br />
By running this script, you will get output of prediced targets,response,side effects for the given drug <br />
